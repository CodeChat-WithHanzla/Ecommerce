# Ecommerce
The project is an E-commerce website built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The backend (Node.js, Express) manages the API and product data in MongoDB, while the frontend (React) handles the UI, fetching and displaying product details. Users can browse, purchase products, and interact seamlessly with the system.
